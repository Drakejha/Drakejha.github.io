Introduction:<h4>Heading level 4</h4>

In this project I use machine learning to predict the strength of a poker hand from the five cards that are dealt. The idea is simple: if a computer can look at the suits and ranks of the cards and guess whether the hand is “nothing”, “one pair”, “two pairs”, “full house”, etc., then it has learned something real about how poker works. Poker is a good test problem because there are many possible hands, but strong hands are rare, which makes the classification task unbalanced and challenging.

The dataset I chose contains tens of thousands of example poker hands for training, and one million hands for testing. Each hand is described by ten integers: five suits (S1–S5) and five card ranks (C1–C5). The target label, called hand, is a number from 0 to 9 that encodes the type of poker hand (0 = “nothing in hand”, 1 = “one pair”, up to 9 = “royal flush”). My main goal is to train models that can map these ten input numbers to the correct hand class.

To solve this as a supervised learning problem, I applied several classification algorithms we studied in class. I first built a very simple baseline that always predicts the most common class in the training data, so I can see whether my real models are actually doing better than a “dumb” guesser. Then I trained three models: Logistic Regression, a Decision Tree, and a Random Forest. All of them were trained on part of the data and tuned/evaluated on a separate validation split, before being tested on the large 1,000,000-row test set.

To measure how good each model is, I used the error metrics from Lecture 2.3 for classification: accuracy, confusion matrices, and the precision, recall, and F1-scores for each class. Overall accuracy tells me how often the model is correct, but the confusion matrix and per-class scores show a more detailed picture, especially for the rare strong hands. In the results, I find that the Random Forest clearly performs best on overall accuracy and does a better job than the other models at picking up stronger hands, although it still struggles with the very rare classes.
